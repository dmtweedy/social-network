# Social Network API

## Description
This assignment is an API backend application utilizing NodeJS, MongoDB, mongoose, and ExpressJS. Multiple Javascript files were used with schema/models/route/seed files set up in a modular fashion for ease of development. This resulted in a back end app used to view, create, update, and delete API data from a database for a social network based company. Below is a link to a video demonstration of the application.
